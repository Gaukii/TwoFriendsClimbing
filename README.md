<h1>Two Friends Climbing</h1>

Hi ! Thanks for downloading Two Friends Climbing

This is a platformer game (still work in progress) where your goal is to help two friends reaching for the top of a mountain.<br>
To that, they can jump and run, but also use an innovative technique: the swing.

<h2>Swing</h2>
The swing helps to reach platforms that are too far for a mere jump. When swinging, the leader throws their friend in an arc. When the friend lands, they become the leader.

If the follower is too far behind, the leader can pull them with the rope.

If the follower is to a better place than the leader, you can swap the roles. The follower becomes the leader and is now able to pull their friend to them 

<h2>Execution</h2>
Simply run TwoFriendsClimbing.exe.
